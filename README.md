# REST Data Model Python
This project is a prototype for building a REST API using Python. It consists of server and client code and simulates a simple data exchange.

To be able to run the code Python has to be installed.


## Instructions to run the code
First run the server:
```
python3 server.py
```

Then run the client:
```
python3 client.py testfile.txt
```

Additionally, the create-file.py can be used for creating a test file with a specified size. For example running:
```
python3 create-file.py 512
```
will create a file of 512 MB.
